# The reversi game 

This is a project that implements the different aspects of board game Reversi, 
including one basic board to display current game and an I/O using pair of numbers
as location and +-1 as color. 

This game also includes several artificial intellegence methods to play with, including 
the one based on memory-intenside iteration min-max search tree, the recursion 
version of min-max search tree and the one using alpha-beta search tree.
